## 🎨 Responsive Spacing System

Your portfolio now uses intelligent spacing:

```
Mobile:   px-3 sm:px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-8
Padding:  1rem -> 1.5rem -> 1.5rem -> 2rem
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Mobile Breakpoint
If you want to adjust where mobile layout changes to tablet:
- Open `components/Navbar.jsx`
- Find `md:hidden` and replace with `sm:hidden` or `lg:hidden`

### Adjust Touch Button Size
If buttons feel too large/small:
- Edit `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]` values in components
- Standard is 44px (Apple/Google recommendation)

### Change Primary Color
All components use `bg-purple-600`. To change:
- Search for `purple-600` and replace with your color
- Suggested: `blue-600`, `indigo-600`, `emerald-600`
