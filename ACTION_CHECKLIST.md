## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### ‚ùå Text looks blurry on mobile
**Solution:** This is usually just DevTools scaling. Works fine on real devices.

### ‚ùå Buttons too small to click
**Solution:** All buttons now have 44px minimum height. If issue persists, check browser zoom level.

### ‚ùå Horizontal scrolling appears
**Solution:** Should not happen. Check if custom CSS has `overflow-x: auto` somewhere.

### ‚ùå Menu doesn't close after clicking
**Solution:** This is by design. Click a link or click outside to close.

### ‚ùå Modal won't close
**Solution:** Click the X button or background to close. Works on all devices.
